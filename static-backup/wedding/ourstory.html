        <h2>First Date <small>(According to Kristi)</small></h2>
            <p>Our first date was at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul's beautiful Cathedral Hill neighborhood, where I was living at the time. We met online and only had to exchange a few emails before deciding to meet. I meant to arrive at the early enough to get there first, tell the bartender that I was on a blind date and he should intervene if it looked to be going poorly. When I arrived, Ted was already sitting at the bar in the spot I was planning to sit! This was the last time I've known Ted to be early for something. After that night, we dated for three years, and had a lot of fun along the way. We love enjoying good food and beer at local establishments, getting outside, traveling to state and national parks, visiting family and friends, and we spend a lot of time cooking and grilling at home.</p>
        <h2>The Proposal <small>(According to Ted)</small></h2>
            <p>On Thursday, May 9, Kristi, a few friends and I went to the <a href="http://www.bravenewworkshop.com/" target="_blank">Brave New Workshop</a> to celebrate Kristi's Birthday. At the end of the show, during an improv session, Kristi was called up onstage. They asked her about a childhood memory, which they then re-enacted. They then asked about her first job and re-enacted that. Finally they asked if there was anyone special in the audience ...luckily she claimed me. I joined her on stage, and after a few questions, they re-enacted our first date. They then said "we at The Brave New Workshop can see into your future" which was my cue.  She said yes!
