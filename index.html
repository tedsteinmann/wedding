          <h4>Our Story (according to Kristi)</h4>
          <p>Our first date was at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul's beautiful Cathedral Hill neighborhood, where I was living at the time. We met online and only had to exchange a few emails before deciding to meet. Our first date was postponed. I assumed that sneezing in his beer would be a poor first impression, so we rescheduled for the next week. I meant to arrive at the early enough to get there first, tell the bartender that I was on a blind date and he should intervene if it looked to be going poorly. When I arrived, Ted was already sitting at the bar in the spot I was planning to sit! He assured me this may never happen again. After that night, we dated for three years, and had a lot of fun along the way. We love enjoying good food and beer at local establishments, getting outside, traveling to state and national parks, visiting family and friends, and we spend a lot of time cooking and grilling at home.</p>

          <h4>Ceremony</h4>
          <p>The Ceremony will be held at 2:00 p.m. in the <a href="http://www.sjn.org/phocadownload/emmaus%20chapel%20brochure%202012.pdf">Emmaus Chapel</a> at St. John Neumann Catholic Church in Eagan, Minnesota.

Please be present with us during the sacrament and refrain from photography or cell phone use.</p>
          <h4>Reception</h4>
          <p>The reception will be held at the Mendakota Country Club in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Cocktail hour will begin at 5:30 p.m. and dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m. You will have some downtime between the ceremony and reception, and we encourage you to visit with other guests back at your hotel or at a nearby pub. We recommend the <a href="http://lone-oakgrill.com/" target="_blank">Lone Oak Grill</a> in Eagan for their apps and beer selection,  <a href"http://teresasmexicanrest.com/" target="_blank">Teresa's</a> on Highway 110 for their margaritas or the <a href="http://www.mendoberri.com/" target="_blank">Mendoberri</a> Wine Bar and Caf√©. If you are staying at the Courtyard by Marriott, you may take a shuttle from the hotel to the reception site before the reception, which will allow you to be car-free in the evening should you decide to take advantage of the hotel shuttle to get you back to the hotel safely!</p>
          <h4>Accomodations</h4>
          <p>We're working with the Courtyard by Marriott in Mendota Heights on a block of rooms. Please check back in late September. Scheduled shuttle service to and from the reception will be made available.</p>
